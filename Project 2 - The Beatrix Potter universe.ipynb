    "## *Finding stories in cultural products*\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an example of how it is possible to find *stories* in collections of cultural products (literature, lyrics, movie and TV scripts, etc.) if we look for a newsworthy angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to achieve this is to plan ahead, and have the story ready to be published on a significant date (a relevant anniversary, the celebration of a festival, or by the end of a given period of time (year, end of a season, etc.)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we have selected the works of author Beatrix Potter, which constitute a finite sample, since she is deceased. A preliminar goal to approach the collection could be determining which were the animals that she prefered as characters of her books, but we could find other elements to highlight along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could also be one of those rare cases in which using a word cloud could be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data could be presented in the form of an infographic.\n",

    "\n",
    "We copied and pasted the list to a spreadsheet in Excel, separated the text into two columns - one for the title, one for the year of publication - and then found each story in the [Gutenberg Project website](http://gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/292).\n",

    "One important issue brought to our attention with the experience of this project is the ethical and legal issues linked to data collection, specifically scraping restrictions. It was a motivation to do more research about the topic and learn about the limits, the options, and possible alternatives to the problem.\n",

    "We also learned that term frequencies can have special significance in relation to the nature of the collection. While a frequently used term by a politician could point to an issue that is a priority to their party, in fiction it can point to differences between characters, namely, who are the main and secondary characters based on mentions. \n",
